__Who is really the very best, like no one ever was?__

__Pokémon Stats Dataset:__ https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2
### Exercise 1
The goal here is to use the PokeAPI to do the following analysis:
__Data Analysis & Visualization__
-	Simple Analysis
-	Analysis on Base Stats
-	Explain why sometimes “superior” Pokémon lose to “inferior” Pokémon?
  -	Build a case for your hypothesis based on the data
-	What Pokémon have the highest winning percentages?
__Data Cleansing & Predicting__
-	Completing Data
-	Predicting
  -	What is the most important feature/stat for predicting winning?

### Exercise 2
The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model able to predict the result of future Pokémon combats. For this we will not be using the PokeAPI, but the three .csv files in the #coding-challenge Slack channel.
